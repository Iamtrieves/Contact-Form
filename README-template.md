## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete the form and see a success toast message upon successful submission
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A required field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- Have inputs, error messages, and the success message announced on their screen reader
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

Absolutely, let's break down the code line by line:

**1. Comments:**

- The code starts with comments wrapped in `/* */`. Comments are ignored by the browser and are used to explain the code for humans.

**2. Initializations:**

- Lines 3-12 declare variables using `const` (constant) to store references to different parts of the form.
    - `form`: This variable holds a reference to the entire form element using `document.querySelector('.container')`. The `.container` part selects the form element with the class `container`.
    - Similar lines follow for `firstName`, `lastName`, `email`, and other form elements using `document.getElementById('id')`. This selects elements by their unique IDs.

**3. Errors:**

- Lines 14-20 declare variables to store references to the error messages displayed for each field.
    - Similar to the previous section, these use `document.querySelector` to select elements with classes like `.first-name-error`.

**4. Radio Button Active State:**

- Lines 22-35 handle the visual effects for the radio button options (general enquiry and support request).
    - `document.querySelectorAll('input[type="radio"]')` selects all radio button elements in the form.
    - A `forEach` loop iterates through each radio button.
        - Inside the loop, an event listener is added using `addEventListener('change')`. This listens for the `change` event on each radio button.
            - When a radio button is clicked (causing the change event), another `forEach` loop iterates through all elements with the class `.radio-option` (likely the visual representation of the radio buttons).
                - Inside this inner loop, the background color and border color of each `.radio-option` element are reset to default values (empty string).
            - Finally, the background and border color of the parent element of the clicked radio button (which likely has the class `.radio-option`) are set to specific green colors using CSS variables.

**5. Function: checkEmpty**

- Lines 37-47 define a function named `checkEmpty` that takes two arguments:
    - `field`: This is a reference to a form element (like `firstName`).
    - `error`: This is a reference to the error message element for that field (like `firstNameError`).
- The function checks if the value of the `field` is empty using `if (field.value == "")`.
    - If it's empty, the error message element's class is removed from `hidden` (making it visible).
    - The border color of the `field` is set to red using a CSS variable.
    - A timeout function is used with `setTimeout` to hide the error message again after 3 seconds. The function inside the timeout removes the `hidden` class from the error message element and resets the border color.
- The function returns `true` if the field is not empty, otherwise `false`.

**6. Function: checkEmail**

- Lines 49-79 define a function named `checkEmail` that also takes two arguments:
    - `email`: This is a reference to the email input field.
    - `error`: This is a reference to the error message element for the email field.
- Similar to `checkEmpty`, it first checks if the `email` field is empty. If it is, it displays an error message and sets the border color to red.
- Otherwise, it checks for several invalid characters in the email address using a series of `if` statements: `@`, `.`, special characters, etc. 
  - It also checks for some edge cases like having multiple dots (`.`) or the dot being at the end of the email address.
    - If an invalid character is found, it displays a more specific error message "Please enter a valid email address" and sets the border color to red.
- The function again uses a timeout to hide the error message after 3 seconds.
- It returns `true` if the email is valid, otherwise `false`.

**7. Function: checkQuery**

- Lines 81-88 define a function named `checkQuery` that takes two arguments:
    - `queries`: This is an array containing references to the two radio button elements (general enquiry and support request).
    - `error`: This is a reference to the error message element for query selection.
- The function uses a loop to iterate through each element in the `queries` array.
    - Inside the loop, it checks if the `checked` property of the current element is `true` (meaning it's selected).
        - If a radio button is selected, the loop breaks using `return;


## Line-by-line explanation of the remaining code:

**1. Function: checkQuery (continued)**

- **Line 81:** `// Function to check if a query type is selected` - This is a comment explaining the purpose of the function.
- **Line 82:** `function checkQuery(queries, error) {` - This line defines the `checkQuery` function with two arguments: `queries` (an array of radio button elements) and `error` (a reference to the error message element).
- **Line 83:** `let checked = false;` - This line declares a variable `checked` and initializes it to `false`. This variable will be used to track if any radio button is selected.
- **Line 84:** `queries.forEach(query => { ... });` - This line iterates through each element in the `queries` array using a `forEach` loop.
    - Inside the loop, each element (`query`) represents a radio button element.
- **Line 85:** `if (query.checked) { ... }` - This line checks if the `checked` property of the current radio button (`query`) is `true` (meaning it's selected).
    - **Line 86:** `checked = true;` - If a radio button is selected, this line sets `checked` to `true`.
    - **Line 87:** `return;` - This line exits the `forEach` loop immediately if a radio button is found selected.
- **Line 88:** `if (!checked) { ... }` - This line checks if `checked` is still `false` after the loop (meaning no radio button was selected).
    - **Line 89:** `error.classList.remove('hidden');` - If no radio button is selected, this line removes the `hidden` class from the error message element, making it visible.
    - **Line 90-92:** This block uses `setTimeout` to hide the error message again after 3 seconds. It works similarly to previous functions.
    - **Line 93:** `return false;` - This line returns `false` to indicate the validation failed (no query type selected).
- **Line 94:** `return true;` - If the loop finishes iterating and `checked` is still `false` (no selection), the function returns `false`. Otherwise, it returns `true` (a query type is selected).

**2. Function: checkCheckbox**

- **Line 96:** `// Function to check for consent checkbox` - This is a comment explaining the purpose of the function.
- **Line 97:** `function checkCheckbox(checkbox, error) { ... }` - This line defines the `checkCheckbox` function with two arguments: `checkbox` (a reference to the consent checkbox element) and `error` (a reference to the error message element).
- **Line 98:** `if (!checkbox.checked) { ... }` - This line checks if the `checked` property of the `checkbox` element is `false` (meaning it's not checked).
    - **Line 99:** `error.classList.remove('hidden');` - If the checkbox is not checked, this line removes the `hidden` class from the error message element, making it visible.
    - **Line 100-102:** This block uses `setTimeout` to hide the error message again after 3 seconds (similar to previous functions).
    - **Line 103:** `return false;` - This line returns `false` to indicate the validation failed (consent checkbox not checked).
- **Line 104:** `return true;` - If the checkbox is checked, the function returns `true` (validation passed).

**3. Toast message upon submission**

- **Line 106:** `// Toast message upon submission` - This is a comment explaining the purpose of this code block.
- **Line 107:** `form.addEventListener('submit', function(e){ ... });` - This line adds an event listener to the `form` element. It listens for the `submit` event (when the form is submitted).
    - The event listener function takes an argument `e` which represents the event object.
- **Line 108:** The long `if` statement checks all validation functions:
    - It calls `checkEmpty` for `firstName`, `lastName`, and `message` to ensure they are not empty.
    - It calls `checkEmail` for `email` to validate the email format.
    - It calls `checkQuery` with the array of radio buttons and the error message to ensure a query type is
    ## Explanation of the code (starting from line 109):

**1. Function: checkCheckbox (already explained)**

- Lines 109-114 remain the same functionality as explained earlier. This function checks if the consent checkbox is selected and displays an error message if not.

**2. Toast message upon submission (continued)**

- **Line 116:** `// Toast message upon submission` - This comment remains the same, explaining the purpose of this code block.
- **Line 117:** `form.addEventListener('submit', function(e){ ... });` - This line remains the same. It adds an event listener to the form element that listens for the `submit` event (when the form is submitted).
- **Line 118:** The long `if` statement continues with the validation checks:
    - **Line 118-123:** It calls previously defined functions like `checkEmpty`, `checkEmail`, and `checkQuery` to ensure all required fields are filled and formatted correctly, and a query type is selected.
    - **Line 124:** It calls the `checkCheckbox` function (explained above) with the `consent` checkbox element and its associated error message to validate if the consent checkbox is checked.

**Overall functionality:**

When the form is submitted, the code checks all the validation functions. If any of the checks fail (empty fields, invalid email, missing query selection, or unchecked consent checkbox), the `if` statement evaluates to `true`. This prevents the default form submission behavior using `e.preventDefault()`.

However, if all the validation checks pass (including the `checkCheckbox` function returning `true`), the `else` block executes. Here's what happens in the `else` block:

- **Line 125:** `e.preventDefault();` - This prevents the default form submission behavior even though all validations passed. This is likely because the code wants to handle the submission differently (showing a toast message).
- **Line 126:** `e.target.reset();` - This resets the form, clearing all the entered data.
- **Line 127-128:** These lines likely reset the visual state of the radio button options (removing custom background and border colors).
- **Line 129:** `var toastBox = document.querySelector('.toastBox');` - This line selects the element with the class `.toastBox` (likely a container for the toast message).
- **Line 130:** `toastBox.classList.remove('toastHidden');` - This line removes the `toastHidden` class from the toast message element, making it visible.
- **Line 131-133:** This block uses `setTimeout` to hide the toast message again after 3 seconds. It works similarly to previous functions.

In summary, this code snippet handles form submission. It validates all fields and the consent checkbox, prevents default submission, resets the form, and displays a toast message for a short duration.
